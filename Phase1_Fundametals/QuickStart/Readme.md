# Quick Start of PyTorch

In this example, we explore how to use PyTorch to load a simple model using the FashionMNIST dataset. The model is trained to predict the output classes of the dataset.

### Key Details:
1. **Dataset:** FashionMNIST  
   - A popular dataset for image classification tasks with 10 classes.

2. **Batch Size:** 32  
   - Training is performed in mini-batches of 32 samples for efficient computation.

3. **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss  
   - Ideal for multi-class classification problems.

4. **Optimizer:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)  
   - A simple and effective optimizer commonly used for image classification tasks.

5. **Learning Rate:** 0.001  
   - A small learning rate for stable convergence during training.

### Steps Covered:
- Loading and preprocessing the FashionMNIST dataset.
- Defining a simple neural network architecture.
- Training the model using the specified loss function and optimizer.
- Evaluating the model's performance.

### Why FashionMNIST?
FashionMNIST is a great starting point for beginners in PyTorch as it provides a straightforward image classification problem with manageable complexity.
