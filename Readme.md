# PyTorch Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I document everything I learn while working on various projects using **PyTorch**, focusing on building a solid understanding of this powerful deep learning framework.

## Goals

- Track my progress as I explore and implement PyTorch concepts.
- Showcase how I approach learning, starting from foundational topics to advanced implementations.
- Apply my knowledge to real-world projects, with a focus on:
  - **Transformers**
  - **Computer Vision**
  - **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: PyTorch Fundamentals
I’ll begin with the official [PyTorch Learning Resources](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/introyt_index.html), working through tutorials and examples. This phase is all about understanding the basics and getting hands-on experience with:

- Tensors and operations
- Building and training models
- Autograd and optimization
- Data loading and preprocessing

### Phase 2: Applied Learning
Once I complete the foundational phase, I’ll start applying what I’ve learned in projects. These projects will involve:

- Implementing and fine-tuning **transformer models** for natural language processing tasks.
- Creating deep learning models for **computer vision**, including object detection and image classification.
- Exploring **reinforcement learning**, training agents to solve specific tasks.
